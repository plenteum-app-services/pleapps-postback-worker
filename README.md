## Prerequisites

* [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)

## Foreword

We know that this documentation needs cleaned up and made easier to read. We'll compile it as part of the full documentation as the project moves forward.

## Setup

1) Clone this repository to wherever you'd like the API to run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TurtlePay/turtlepay-postback-worker
```

2) Install the required Node.js modules

```bash
cd turtlepay-postback-worker && npm install
```

3) Use your favorite text editor to change the values as necessary in `config.json`

```javascript
{
  "queues": {
    "complete": "complete.wallet"
  },
  "postTimeout": 5000
}
```

4) Fire up the script

```bash
export RABBIT_PUBLIC_SERVER=localhost
